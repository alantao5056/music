# Introduction
Music has evolved over time and there are a lot of factors that define a music's genre and popularity. I downloaded all my music data from Kaggle. They are accurate because they mostly all come from the Spotify API. I cleaned it by removing some of the NA values, and also sometimes grouping some categories together such as genre or artists to create graphs. Music duration and valence has decreased 20% from 1999 to 2019.
